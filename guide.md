# Definitions

## How we define Event?

* [Domain Event](https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/DomainEvent.html): Captures the memory of something interesting which affects the domain.

* [Streaming services event](https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/designing-event-driven-systems.csp):  event both a fact and notification

![Command &amp; Event &amp; Query](.gitbook/assets/command-event-query.png)

Domain Event: 

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
